# Course Assignment 1

## Introduction

_"The business idea is about to create a platform that not only provides information about people 
and their hobbies but also offers a matchmaking service. Users can input their hobbies and interests, and the 
platform can connect them with like-minded individuals or groups in their local area. This would add a social 
networking element to the service and encourage people to explore new hobbies together, fostering real-world connections."_

This business idea is one of many you can think of. There are, however, a few restrictions that you must adhere to.
For instance, users who register must be able to enter their hobbies, phone number and ultimately their full address in their profile.
Of course, the user stories mentioned below must also play into your considerations.

Your task is to find a business idea where users and hobbies play a central role. You can, of course, make the above 
business concept your own and perhaps expand on it.

Once you have come up with a business idea, your next step will be to develop a domain model. This will make it easier 
for you to keep an overall perspective over your business plan. Conceptional a domain model is a representation of the
problem domain (the subject area the software deals with). It defines the entities, their attributes, and how they relate to each other in the real-world context.



The last step is to create a diagram that mirrors your future database, also known as an EER diagram.

Your Domain Model and EER diagram will be the foundation for your database and the JPA entities you will create in the next step. Both
diagram should be added to your README.md file with the business idea and user stories.

Happy coding!

### Optional Requirements

- [O1] TODO


### Resources

- [ZipCode - Hobby](https://github.com/dat3startcode/dataForCA-2 )

Alternatively and more challenging can the data for City Info be requested from the following API:
- [Dataforsyning]https://api.dataforsyningen.dk/postnumre
