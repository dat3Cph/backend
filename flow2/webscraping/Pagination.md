# Web scraping Pagination Example


## Pagination in Web Scraping

Pagination in the context of web scraping refers to the process of systematically navigating through multiple 
pages of a website to extract data. It's commonly used when a website displays content across multiple pages, such as 
search results, product listings, or articles. The key steps in pagination for web scraping are:

1. **Load Initial Page:** Begin by accessing and parsing the first page of content that you want to scrape.

2. **Identify Pagination Elements:** Locate and interact with HTML elements (e.g., "Next" buttons or page numbers) 
that allow you to move to the next page or specific pages of content.

3. **Extract Data:** Scrape the desired data from the current page.

4. **Navigate to Next Page:** If applicable, proceed to the next page using the identified pagination elements.

5. **Repeat:** Continue this process until you have scraped data from all relevant pages.

Pagination is essential for collecting comprehensive data from websites with multiple pages of content efficiently.

## Pagination Example

Let's walk through an example of pagination in web scraping. We'll scrape data from the [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com/)

### Load Initial Page

The first step is to load the initial page of content that we want to scrape. In this case, we'll load the first page of
quotes from the [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com/) website.

```java
String url = "http://quotes.toscrape.com/";
Document doc = Jsoup.connect(url).get();
```

### Identify Pagination Elements

Next, we need to identify the pagination elements that we'll use to navigate to the next page of content. In this case,
we'll use the "Next" button to navigate to the next page of quotes.

```java
Element nextButton = doc.selectFirst("li.next > a");
```

### Extract Data

Now that we've loaded the initial page and identified the pagination elements, we can extract the desired data from the
current page. In this case, we'll extract the quote text and author from each quote on the page.

```java
Elements quotes = doc.select("div.quote");
for (Element quote : quotes) {
    String quoteText = quote.selectFirst("span.text").text();
    String author = quote.selectFirst("small.author").text();
    System.out.println(quoteText + " - " + author);
}
```

### Navigate to Next Page

Finally, we can navigate to the next page of content using the identified pagination elements. In this case, we'll
navigate to the next page of quotes by clicking the "Next" button.

```java
if (nextButton != null) {
    String nextPageUrl = nextButton.attr("abs:href");
    doc = Jsoup.connect(nextPageUrl).get();
}
```

### Repeat

We can repeat this process until we have scraped data from all relevant pages. In this case, we'll scrape data from all
pages of quotes until the "Next" button is no longer present.

```java
while (nextButton != null) {
    // Extract data from current page
    Elements quotes = doc.select("div.quote");
    for (Element quote : quotes) {
        String quoteText = quote.selectFirst("span.text").text();
        String author = quote.selectFirst("small.author").text();
        System.out.println(quoteText + " - " + author);
    }

    // Navigate to next page
    if (nextButton != null) {
        String nextPageUrl = nextButton.attr("abs:href");
        doc = Jsoup.connect(nextPageUrl).get();
        nextButton = doc.selectFirst("li.next > a");
    }
}
```

## What's Next?

In this tutorial, we walked through an example of pagination in web scraping. We loaded the initial page of content,
identified the pagination elements, extracted the desired data, and navigated to the next page of content. We repeated
this process until we had scraped data from all relevant pages.

The important part now is that you understand each line of code and how it works. You can use this example as a
template for your own web scraping projects. You can also check out the [documentation for JSoup](https://jsoup.org/).

Happy scraping!
