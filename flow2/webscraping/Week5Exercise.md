# Web scraping a movie site
This exercise combines web scraping using Jsoup, handling dynamic content with Selenium, and reading data from a REST API into DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). 
This exercise simulates scraping information about movies from a website and then enriching the data with additional information from a movie database API.

**Exercise: Movie Data Enrichment**

1. **Web Scraping (Jsoup and Selenium):**

   You want to scrape a website that lists movie titles of the top 250 most popular movies (https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250) and their brief descriptions (including their rating). The catch is that the descriptions are loaded dynamically as you scroll down the page. Here's what you can do:

   - Use Jsoup to fetch the initial page content.
   - Use Selenium to scroll down the page and wait for dynamic content to load.
   - Extract movie titles and descriptions from the scraped content.

2. **API Data Retrieval and DTOs:**

   After obtaining the movie titles and ratings from the website, you'll enrich the data by fetching additional information from a movie database API. Here's what you can do:

   - Use a movie database API (e.g., The Movie Database API - TMDb: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to retrieve detailed information about movies based on their titles.
   - Create a Java class representing a Movie DTO (e.g., `MovieDTO`) with fields like title, description, release date, genres, etc.
   - For each scraped movie title, make a REST API request to the movie database API to fetch additional information.
   - Parse the API response and map it to the MovieDTO class.

Here's a general outline of how you might structure your code for this exercise:

```java
public class MovieScraper {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Part 1: Web Scraping with Jsoup and Selenium
        // ...

        // Part 2: API Data Retrieval and DTOs
        // ...

        // Combine the scraped data and API-enriched data into MovieDTO objects
        List<MovieDTO> movies = mergeData(scrapedMovies, apiEnrichedMovies);

        // Print or process the enriched movie data
        for (MovieDTO movie : movies) {
            System.out.println(movie);
        }
    }

    // Implement the scraping and API data retrieval here
    // ...

    // Merge scraped data and API-enriched data into MovieDTO objects
    private static List<MovieDTO> mergeData(List<ScrapedMovie> scrapedMovies, List<ApiEnrichedMovie> apiEnrichedMovies) {
        List<MovieDTO> mergedMovies = new ArrayList<>();

        // Implement the merging logic here
        // ...

        return mergedMovies;
    }
}
```

In this exercise, you'll need to design and implement the details of scraping, using Selenium for dynamic content, making API requests, parsing JSON responses, and mapping data to DTOs. This exercise will provide you with a hands-on opportunity to work with web scraping, dynamic content, REST API integration, and object mapping.

Please note that you'll need to replace placeholders like `ScrapedMovie`, `ApiEnrichedMovie`, and `MovieDTO` with actual class names and structures that match your implementation. Additionally, you'll need to sign up for the movie database API and obtain an API key for making requests.
