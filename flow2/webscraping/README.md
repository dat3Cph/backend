## Learning objectives

1. **Understanding HTML and CSS:** Learn the basics of HTML structure and CSS selectors, as they are essential for identifying and extracting data from web pages.

2. **Library Familiarity:** Gain an understanding of the web scraping library you're using: Jsoup, including its API, methods, and capabilities.

3. **Fetching Web Content:** Learn how to make HTTP requests to fetch the HTML content of web pages.

4. **HTML Parsing:** Understand how to parse the HTML content retrieved from web pages and navigate through the HTML document's structure.

5. **CSS Selectors:** Master the usage of CSS selectors to precisely target and extract specific HTML elements from the page.

6. **Data Extraction:** Learn various techniques to extract data, such as text, links, images, tables, and other content, from the parsed HTML.

7. **Using Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to extract data from HTML elements that are not easily accessible using CSS selectors.

8. **Handling Dynamic Content:** Understand how to deal with websites that load content dynamically using JavaScript. Consider using headless browsers or additional tools if necessary.

9. **Error Handling:** Develop strategies to handle potential errors, such as network failures, invalid HTML, or unexpected changes to the website structure.

10. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Explore techniques to clean and preprocess the extracted data, including removing unnecessary elements, formatting, and converting data types.

11. **Crawling vs. Scraping:** Differentiate between web crawling (collecting links and data from multiple pages) and web scraping (extracting specific data from a single page).

12. **Pagination and Navigation:** Discover methods to handle paginated content and navigate through multiple pages to scrape comprehensive data.

13. **Testing and Maintenance:** Develop strategies for testing your web scraping code to ensure its accuracy and robustness. Regularly maintain your code to accommodate website changes.

14. **Rest API:** Learn how to use a REST API to retrieve data from websites that provide one.

15. **Consuming JSON**: Learn how to parse JSON data and extract the required information using DTOs.
