## Day 2: Streams and Generics

## Streams
1. Introduction to Streams and their benefits.
Java Streams provide several benefits that simplify and enhance the process of working with collections and processing data. Here are some key advantages of using Java Streams:

- **Readability and Expressiveness:** Streams enable you to express complex data transformations and processing in a more concise and readable manner. This leads to more maintainable and understandable code.
- **Declarative Programming:** With streams, you focus on describing the operations you want to perform on the data, rather than how to perform them. This promotes a declarative programming style, making your code more intuitive.
- **Functional Programming:** Streams introduce functional programming concepts to Java, such as immutability, first-class functions, and higher-order functions. This results in cleaner code that is easier to reason about and test.
- **Lazy Evaluation:** Streams use lazy evaluation, meaning that elements are processed only when needed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.
- **Parallelism:** Streams can be easily parallelized, enabling concurrent processing of data on multi-core processors. This can lead to significant performance improvements for data-intensive tasks.
- **Method Chaining:** Streams support method chaining, allowing you to chain multiple operations together. This leads to more compact and fluent code.
- **Data Aggregation:** Streams provide various aggregation operations, such as sum, average, min, and max, which simplify common data summarization tasks.
- **Filtering and Mapping:** Streams offer operations like `filter` and `map` that make it easy to transform and filter data elements based on certain conditions.
- **Reduction:** Streams support reduction operations, such as `reduce`, that allow you to combine elements of a collection into a single result.
-  **No Temporary Collections:** Many stream operations don't require intermediate collections. This can save memory and improve efficiency compared to traditional looping with collections.
-  **Focus on What, Not How:** Streams abstract away the looping and iteration details, allowing you to focus on the logic of what you want to achieve rather than the mechanics of how to achieve it.
-  **Easier Debugging:** Streams' fluent style of coding can make it easier to locate errors and debug issues, as each operation can be inspected individually.

In summary, Java Streams offer a more functional and declarative way to process data, leading to cleaner, more expressive, and potentially more performant code. They bring the benefits of functional programming to Java collections, making it easier to write efficient, concise, and maintainable code for data manipulation and transformation.

2. Creating Streams: from collections, arrays, and static factory methods.
   - peek(), limit(), skip(), distinct(), sorted()
3. Intermediate and terminal operations in Streams.
4. Common intermediate operations: map, filter, flatMap, distinct, sorted.
5. Common terminal operations: forEach, collect, reduce, count, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch.
   - min(), max(), findFirst(), findAny(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch()

## Collectors
6. Overview of Collectors and their role in Stream operations.
7. Built-in Collectors: toList, toSet, toMap, joining, groupingBy, partitioningBy.
8. Creating custom Collectors.

## Optional
9. Handling null values using Optional.
10. Creating and manipulating Optionals.
11. When to use Optional effectively.

7. **Generic Collections and Wildcards:**
   - Using generic collections (e.g., ArrayList\<T\>)
   - Using wildcards to allow flexibility in method parameters

8. **Bounded Type Parameters:**
   - Restricting type parameters to specific classes or interfaces
   - Implementing methods that work with bounded type parameters

9. **Generic Interfaces and Multiple Bounds:**
   - Defining interfaces with multiple type parameter bounds
   - Using "extends" and "implements" with type parameters

10. **Generics and Method Overloading:**
