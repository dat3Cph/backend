**REST**

1. Define REST: Explain the principles and concepts of Representational State Transfer (REST) in web services.
2. HTTP Methods: Describe the various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used in RESTful APIs and their corresponding
   CRUD operations.
3. Resource Identification: Understand how to identify and structure resources using URIs in RESTful design.
4. Statelessness: Explain the importance of statelessness in REST and how it simplifies interactions between clients and
   servers.
5. Status Codes: Learn about common HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500) and their meanings in RESTful API responses.

**Javalin**

1. Routing and Endpoints: Learn how to define routes and endpoints in Javalin to map HTTP requests to specific handlers or controllers.
2. Middleware(Http filters): Explore the concept of middleware in Javalin and how it can be used to add common functionality (e.g.,logging, authentication) to your web application.
3. Request and Response Handling: Master the techniques for processing and manipulating incoming requests and outgoing responses in Javalin, including parsing and rendering data.
   Certainly, here are the learning objectives that include endpoint groups in Javalin:

Context Object in Javalin: Understand the Javalin `Context` object and how it provides access to information about the current HTTP request and response, including parameters, headers, and the request body.
Route Handlers: Learn how to define and implement route handlers in Javalin to handle specific HTTP endpoints, including how to use the `ctx` parameter to interact with the request and response.
Exception Handling: Explore the techniques for handling exceptions in Javalin, including how to use exception handlers to gracefully handle errors and return appropriate HTTP responses.
Routing in Javalin: Master the concept of routing in Javalin, including how to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and map them to specific route handlers.
Path Parameters: Understand how to use path parameters in Javalin routes to capture dynamic parts of URLs and pass them as parameters to route handlers, enabling flexible and dynamic routing.
Endpoint Groups: Learn how to organize and group related endpoints in Javalin using endpoint groups. Understand how this helps in structuring and managing the routes in a more organized and modular way.
