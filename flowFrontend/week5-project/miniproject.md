# Full Scale SPA mini-project

## Assignment

Together with your group, create a web application of your liking. The idea is that the code can be used for the exam to showcase various learning goals.

The project should be a Single Page Application (SPA) with a frontend developed in React and a backend developed in Javalin. The frontend should communicate with the backend through a REST API.

Examples of projects could be:

- A blog
- A webshop
- A recipe book
- A workout tracker
- Pokemon card collection

The list of requirements are not exhaustive, but you should aim for these:

1. A SPA responsive frontend developed in React, HTML, CSS
2. A simple backend API developed in Javalin with the necessary endpoints to serve your application. The Backend should be built on the architecture we used in the Backend part of 3rd semester. Including JPA, DTOs, CORS header handling, errorhandling and errormessages in json, security with functionality for JWT based logins.
3. Deploy your solution.
4. In react. Make use of:
   - Components
   - A facade for data fetching etc
   - React Router
   - Hooks: useState, useEffect, useParams
   - Props
   - Conditional Rendering
   - Lifting state
   - Controlled input forms
   - Callbacks
   - Authentication and Authorization (Login/Logout/Register/JWT handling)
   - Error handling (Show error messages from the backend)
   - Loading indicators
   - Use of a CSS framework (styled-components, react-icons etc.)
   - All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) should be possible from the frontend

Wwe will look forward to seeing the result on Friday the 31 for a "Grand Demo", and during our interactions until then.
