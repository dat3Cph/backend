- Create a new frontend project with react.
- Make sure that the backend is running on port 8080 and the frontend on port 3000.
- Make you frontend fetch data from the backend and display it.
- Create functionality for creating, updating and deleting data as well.

## Deploy the project

- Setup a docker-compose.yml file that can run both the backend and frontend.
- Deploy the project to a Digital Ocean droplet using docker-compose.
