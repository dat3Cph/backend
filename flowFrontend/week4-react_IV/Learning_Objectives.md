## Learning Objectives

#### React Router:
1. **Define React Router and its Purpose:**
    - Describe React Router as a library for declaratively managing routes in a React application.
    - Explain its purpose in enabling navigation between different components/pages in a single-page application (SPA).

2. **Understand Route Configuration:**
    - Explain how to set up routes using `<Route>` components and the `<BrowserRouter>` or `<HashRouter>` in React.
    - Describe how to define routes with parameters and optional parameters.

3. **Navigation and Linking:**
    - Demonstrate how to use `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components to navigate between different routes.
    - Discuss the differences between `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` and when to use each.

4. **Nested Routes and Route Parameters:**
    - Describe how to define nested routes and access route parameters in React Router.
    - Provide examples of nested routes and accessing route parameters in components.

5. **Programmatic Navigation:**
    - Explain how to perform programmatic navigation in React using the `history` object or the `useHistory` hook.
    - Demonstrate how to navigate to a different route based on user actions or application logic.

6. **Route Guards and Redirects:**
    - Discuss the concept of route guards and how to implement them using `<Redirect>` or custom logic.
    - Provide examples of how to restrict access to certain routes based on user authentication or other conditions.

#### Frontend Authentication with JWT Token, LocalStorage, Cookies:

1. **Introduction to JWT Authentication:**
    - Define JWT (JSON Web Token) and its role in frontend authentication.
    - Explain how JWTs are used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

2. **Understanding LocalStorage and Cookies:**
    - Describe the purpose of LocalStorage and Cookies in storing authentication tokens in the browser.
    - Explain the differences between LocalStorage and Cookies in terms of usage and security considerations.

3. **Token-Based Authentication Flow:**
    - Outline the typical flow of token-based authentication using JWTs in a frontend application.
    - Describe how a user authenticates, receives a JWT token, and subsequently includes it in requests to access protected resources.

4. **Implementing Authentication in React:**
    - Demonstrate how to handle user authentication in a React application using JWT tokens.
    - Provide examples of how to store and retrieve tokens from LocalStorage or Cookies.

5. **Security Considerations and Best Practices:**
    - Discuss security considerations when implementing frontend authentication with JWT tokens.
    - Cover best practices for securely storing and transmitting tokens, handling token expiration, and preventing common security vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.

#### CORS and Same-Origin Policy:
1. **Understanding Same-Origin Policy (SOP):**
    - Define the Same-Origin Policy and its purpose in web security.
    - Explain how SOP restricts interactions between resources from different origins to prevent malicious attacks.

2. **Introduction to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
    - Describe CORS as a mechanism for relaxing the Same-Origin Policy selectively.
    - Explain the need for CORS to allow controlled access to resources from different origins.

3. **CORS Headers and Preflight Requests:**
    - Discuss the role of CORS headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` in enabling cross-origin requests.
    - Explain the concept of preflight requests and when they are triggered by the browser.

4. **Configuring CORS on the Server:**
    - Provide examples of how to configure CORS on a server to allow or restrict cross-origin requests.
    - Discuss common server-side configurations for CORS, including setting allowed origins, methods, and headers.

5. **Handling CORS in Client-Side Code:**
    - Demonstrate how to handle CORS issues in client-side code when making requests to a different origin.
    - Discuss techniques such as JSONP, proxy servers, or using CORS-enabled libraries.

6. **Security Implications and Best Practices:**
    - Explain security implications associated with CORS and how to mitigate common risks.
    - Discuss best practices for configuring CORS securely to prevent unauthorized access or data leaks.
