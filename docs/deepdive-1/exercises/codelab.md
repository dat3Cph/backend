# Deep Dive I CodeLab Exercise

Work in progress ....

This CodeLab exercise is designed to help you practice the concepts you have learned in the Java Deep Dive I module on day-1. You will be working on a series of tasks that involve Java Streams, Java Time API, Lambdas and Generics. We will also practice pair programming and collaboration using Github.

## Exercise Overview

## Instructions

### 1. Team up (2 x 2)

### 2. Setup the development environment (one per team of 2 x 2)

1. One team member should fork [Flight data Repo](https://github.com/dat3Cph/flightapp) - a simple application that reads a CSV file with flight data and calculates the total flight time for each airline.]
2. Add all team members as collaborators to the forked repository
3. Protect the `main` branch and the `develop` branch from pushing directly to it. Only allow Pull Requests to merge into these branches.
4. Every team member should clone the forked repository to their local machine
5. Checkout the develop branch (each member)

### 4. Get aqainted with the code

### 5. Identify tasks, break them down and assign to pair programmers as Issues in Github

Inspiration for tasks:

1. Refactor the code (remove dead code, improve variable names, extract DTO etc.)
2.

### 6. Start working on the tasks (round 1)

1. Create a branch off the `develop` branch for each task
2. Work on the task

### 7. Pull request

1. Create a Pull Request to merge the task branch into the `develop` branch
2. Assign the Pull Request to the other pair for review

### 8. Review

1. Review the Pull Request
2. Provide feedback
3. Merge the Pull Request

### 9. Repeat
