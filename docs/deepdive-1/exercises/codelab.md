# Deep Dive I CodeLab Exercise

Work in progress ....

This CodeLab exercise is designed to help you practice the concepts you have learned in the Java Deep Dive I module on day-1. You will be working on a series of tasks that involve Java Streams, Java Time API, Lambdas and Generics. We will also practice pair programming and collaboration using Github.

## Exercise Overview

## Repository

[Flight data Repo](https://github.com/dat3Cph/flightapp) - a simple application that reads a CSV file with flight data and calculates the total flight time for each airline.]

## Instructions

### 1. Team up (2 x 2)

### 2. Fork the repository (one per team)

### 3. Checkout the develop branch

### 4. Get aqainted with the code

### 5. Identify tasks, break them down and assign to pair programmers as Issues in Github

Inspiration for tasks:

1. Refactor the code (remove dead code, improve variable names, extract DTO etc.)
2.

### 6. Start working on the tasks (round 1)

1. Create a branch off the `develop` branch for each task
2. Work on the task

### 7. Pull request

1. Create a Pull Request to merge the task branch into the `develop` branch
2. Assign the Pull Request to the other pair for review

### 8. Review

1. Review the Pull Request
2. Provide feedback
3. Merge the Pull Request

### 9. Repeat
