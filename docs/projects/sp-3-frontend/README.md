# SP-3: The Frontend Hub

Earlier in the semester, we built a bunch of APIs. So the idea is to build a selection of cool React frontend applications that utilize the APIs. The frontend applications should be built with React, and you should use the tech stack we have used so far. This means that you should use React, React Router, and styling with CSS. The frontend applications should be deployed to a Digital Ocean Droplet. You should also use the deployment pipeline we have introduced. So GitHub Actions, Docker Compose file, and Watchtower to keep the frontend Container up to date. You should also use Caddy to serve the frontend over HTTPS on a sub-domain.

Each team decide on what kind of API they would like to build. Be creative and have fun with it. Remembe though, that other teams should be able to use your product. Therefore each team should document their API. Also, each team will hand in a link to their API so that we can create a common API hub.

## General Requirements

This project is meant to be a group exercise. Teams of 2-3 is preferable, but you can also make a solo project. The scope is 2 weeks.The requirements will follow.
