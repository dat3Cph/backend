## The toolbox

You will need to use the following:

- HTML
- CSS grid or flexbox could be smart
- JavaScript
  - Arrays
  - Functions
  - Variables
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops
- DOM selectors
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Event bubbling / delegation

## The rules

Try not to copy what others have done on the web - or what chatGPT will tell you. Tic Tac Toe is one of the most used games for teaching programming. And there is a reason for that. It's a simple game, but it can be implemented in many ways. And it's a good exercise for you to practice your programming skills.
