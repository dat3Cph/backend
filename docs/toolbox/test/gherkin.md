# Gherkin Syntax

**Gherkin** is a language used for writing structured, human-readable tests in **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**. It is designed to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders by defining test scenarios using natural language and a clear structure. Gherkin syntax is commonly used with tools like **Cucumber** to define test cases in a format that both developers and business analysts can understand.

### Key Concepts in Gherkin Syntax

- **Feature:** Describes a feature of the application being tested. It contains a group of related test scenarios.
- **Scenario:** Represents a single test case, providing a specific example of how the system should behave.
- **Given:** Defines the initial context or preconditions for the scenario (i.e., the starting state).
- **When:** Describes the action or event that triggers the behavior being tested.
- **Then:** Specifies the expected outcome or result after the action has been performed.
- **And/But:** Used to add more conditions to the `Given`, `When`, or `Then` steps.

### Gherkin Syntax Example

```gherkin
Feature: User login
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user should be redirected to the homepage
```

### How Gherkin is Used in Rest Assured

Rest Assured can be used in combination with **Cucumber** to implement BDD-style tests. Gherkin defines the behavior in natural language, and the actual test implementation is done in Java, using Rest Assured for interacting with the REST APIs.

Hereâ€™s how you can integrate Gherkin with Rest Assured:

1. **Define the Feature and Scenario (in `.feature` file):**

   ```gherkin
   Feature: API Testing with Rest Assured
     Scenario: Verify successful GET request to retrieve user details
       Given I have the base URL for the API
       When I send a GET request to "/users/1"
       Then I should receive a 200 OK response
       And the user name should be "John Doe"
   ```

2. **Implement the Step Definitions (in Java code):**
   These steps link the Gherkin scenario to Java code, using Rest Assured to make API calls and validate responses.

   ```java
   import io.restassured.RestAssured;
   import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
   import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
   import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
   import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
   import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;

   public class ApiStepDefinitions {

       @Given("I have the base URL for the API")
       public void setBaseUrl() {
           RestAssured.baseURI = "https://api.example.com";
       }

       @When("I send a GET request to {string}")
       public void sendGetRequest(String endpoint) {
           response = given()
                       .when()
                       .get(endpoint)
                       .then()
                       .extract().response();
       }

       @Then("I should receive a {int} OK response")
       public void verifyResponseCode(int statusCode) {
           response.then().statusCode(statusCode);
       }

       @Then("the user name should be {string}")
       public void verifyUserName(String expectedName) {
           response.then().body("name", equalTo(expectedName));
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Test:**
   Once the steps are defined, you can run the tests using a tool like Cucumber or JUnit. The framework will interpret the Gherkin scenarios and execute the corresponding Java code with Rest Assured to make the HTTP requests and check the responses.

### Why Use Gherkin with Rest Assured

- **Readable and Understandable Tests:** The Gherkin syntax makes test cases easier to understand for both technical and non-technical team members, improving collaboration.
- **BDD Workflow:** It supports the BDD workflow, where the behavior of the system is defined before implementation, ensuring better alignment between development and business goals.
- **Automated API Testing:** When combined with Rest Assured, Gherkin enables automated API testing in a structured, maintainable way that is easy to integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

In summary, **Gherkin syntax** allows for structured, human-readable test definitions, and when used with Rest Assured in a **Cucumber BDD** environment, it facilitates the testing of REST APIs in a clear, maintainable way.
