# Getting started with JavaScript and React

## Learning Objectives

### Monday - JavaScript:
1. **Transition to JavaScript Syntax:**
   - Identify and translate Java concepts (e.g., classes, methods) to JavaScript syntax.
   - Understand key differences like dynamic typing and prototypal inheritance.
   - Data Types:
     - Identify and use JavaScript's primitive data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined).
     - Identify and use JavaScript's complex data types (object, array, function).
     - Understand the difference between primitive and complex data types.
     - Understand the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.
2. **Functional Programming Concepts:**
   - Apply functional programming concepts in JavaScript, leveraging higher-order functions and immutability.
   - Recognize and exploit the benefits of functional programming in real-world scenarios.
3. **Object-Oriented JavaScript:**
   - Translate Java's object-oriented principles to JavaScript, emphasizing prototypes and object composition.

4. **Efficient DOM Manipulation:**
   - Apply efficient DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript.
   - Optimize code for minimizing reflows and repaints.
5. **Integration with Web APIs:**

   - Understand the concept of SPA vs server rendered pages
   - Understand how JSON is used to transfer data between client and server

7. **JavaScript Debugging Proficiency:**
    - Master browser developer tools for JavaScript debugging.
    - Be able to identify and resolve common JavaScript errors.

### Wednesday - React:
1. **Component-Based Architecture:**
    - Understand the concept of components in React.
    - Create and use functional components and understand class components.
2. **JSX Syntax:**
    - Compose UI elements using JSX syntax.
