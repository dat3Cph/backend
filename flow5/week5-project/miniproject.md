# Full Scale SPA Project

## Assignment

Together with your group, create a web application of your liking. The idea is that the code can be used for the exam to showcase various learning goals.

The list of requirements are not exhaustive, but you should aim for these:

1. A SPA responsive frontend developed in React, HTML, CSS
2. A simple backend API developed in Javalin with the necessary endpoints to serve your application. The Backend should be built on the architecture we used in the Backend part of 3rd semester. Including JPA, DTOs, CORS header handling, errorhandling and errormessages in json, security with functionality for JWT based logins.
3. You don't need to deploy your solution - but if you can, then please do it.
4. In react. Make use of:
   - Components
   - A facade for data fetching etc
   - React Router
   - Hooks: useState, useEffect, useParams
   - Props
   - Conditional Rendering
   - Lifting state
   - Controlled input forms
   - Callbacks

You don't need to hand in the assignment, but we will look forward to seeing the result on Friday 22nd for a "Grand Demo", and during our interactions until then.
